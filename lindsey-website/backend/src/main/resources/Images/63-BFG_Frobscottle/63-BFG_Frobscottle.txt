	Frobscottle

ArtDescription 
	Hilarious mixed media illustration of the scene from Roald Dahl's wonderful book The BFG, in which the giant shows his little guest his favorite drink "Frobscottle" which he loves passing gas with. This piece started out as a scribble done by the artist's husband, which she then was tasked with making something out of it, and ended up seeing this delightful scene from one of her favorite authors!
