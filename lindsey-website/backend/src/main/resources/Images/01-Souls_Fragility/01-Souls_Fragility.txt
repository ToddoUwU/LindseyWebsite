Title 
	The Soul's Fragility

ArtDescription
	Contemplative colored pencil portrait of a young injured girl (the artist's daughter following a near death experience), holding an owl and wrapped in a mossy blanket surrounded by a border of moths, symbolism the strength and fragility of the human spirit. After completing portrait the artist found a poem by Mary Oliver that speaks of the soul, and one sentence fit with this painting so well, asking whether the soul is "...fragile like the wings of a moth in the beak of an owl?"
