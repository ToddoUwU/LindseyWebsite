ArtDescription 	
	Work in progress acrylic paint sunflower background for a portrait of the artist's grandmother as a spider crocheting baby blanket webs to wrap her beloved grandchildren in. Her grandma did this for each of her many grand and great grandchildren when they were born and Lindsey's twins loved pretending they were spiderman with their blankies and carried them everywhere. Grandma's kitchen is decorated with sunflowers which she says are a symbol of the most important thing in her life- her family, her "sunshine".  Neon and metallic paints were used in this piece so that no matter the lighting you will see the sunflowers shine or glow.
