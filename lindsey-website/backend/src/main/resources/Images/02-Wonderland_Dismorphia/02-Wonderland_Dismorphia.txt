	Wonderland Dismorphia

ArtDescription 
	Artist's personal interpretation from Alice in Wonderland, an acrylic paint illustration of her child self as Alice being offered by a much larger Cheshire Cat a sugar cookie frosted with "Eat Me." Due to the field of background flowers being abstract it is hard to distinguish if the cat is extra large or Alice has shrunk very small, which ties to the feeling of dysmorphia in the title of the painting and the feelings the artist experienced her whole life as a big-boned, tall girl growing up in boy shaming diet culture in the '90s and early 2000s, never knowing exactly how big or small she really was and the psychological impact of that on a growing girl.
