	Wildflower Daydreams and Memories

ArtDescription 
	Colored pencil portrait reminiscing about the summer I spent with my 5 young children outside during all our free time, playing, crafting, growing a garden, and going for walks.  The background has wildflowers abstracted to look like patchwork quilt pieces as the memories have grown so cozy and warm over the years and struggles our family went through after that summer.
